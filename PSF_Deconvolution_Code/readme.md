## The usage workflow

gdInterpolation.py is the main code for interpolated loss 3D PSF deconvolution 
File-saved: save-pointwise-\[cb1 or pt7] / \[name & config] 

* save.pth;
* poses.bin (location for each point)
* invs/100.bin (the saved PSF deconvolution operators, corresponding with the position of PSF) 

The generated vis.bin is the visualization result
